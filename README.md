# Nano-snake
![Gif of nano snake running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swesen/Nano-snake/master/NanoSnake.gif)

I was inspired by a class group project and the start of my IOT class to run the game of snake on an arduino nano.

By connecting an SSD1306 OLED display via I2C and pulldown buttons to D3-D6.

Only things required:
* A breadboard or PCB
* Arduino nano(or equivalent)
* An 128x64 OLED I2C display
* 4x momentary buttons
* wires
